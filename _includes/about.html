                        I'm a passionate Junior Software Engineer with a strong foundation in design, UX, and problem-solving. 
                        My journey in technology began with a curiosity for creating user-centered solutions that bridge the gap 
                        between functionality and aesthetics.

                        With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building intuitive web applications 
                        that solve real-world problems. My background in design thinking helps me approach development challenges 
                        with a user-first mindset, ensuring that every line of code serves a purpose and enhances the user experience.

                    <p class="large text-muted">
                        I'm constantly learning and expanding my skill set, currently focused on modern web technologies, 
                        responsive design principles, and creating accessible, scalable solutions. When I'm not coding, 
                        you'll find me exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring 
                        others in their tech journey.
