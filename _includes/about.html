                            I'm a passionate Junior Software Engineer with a strong foundation in design, UX, and problem-solving. 
                            My journey in technology began with a curiosity for creating user-centered solutions that bridge the gap 
                            between functionality and aesthetics.

                            With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building intuitive web applications 
                            that solve real-world problems. My background in design thinking helps me approach development challenges 
                            with a user-first mindset, ensuring that every line of code serves a purpose and enhances the user experience.
