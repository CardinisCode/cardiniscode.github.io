            <p>I led the Gas Safety Assessment project from design through to build, creating a native flow in Salesforce Field Service to replace a failing third-party tool.</p>
            <p>This gave engineers a reliable way to capture assessment data in the platform they already used every day.</p>
            <p>Working with our Systems Architect and Salesforce developers, I designed the workflows, reports, and email templates, and configured the required fields in Salesforce.</p>
            <p>The result was a seamless process from engineer submission to customer delivery, improving the experience for engineers, internal teams, and clients alike.</p>

            <p>The client's field service engineers were struggling with a fragile third-party form tool that frequently crashed, causing data loss and workflow interruptions.

            <h2 class="padding-top-30">Solution</h2>
            <p>I adopted a user-centered design approach, focusing on the needs of field service engineers while ensuring seamless integration with existing business processes. My goal was to simplify the gas safety assessment, creating a smooth and positive experience for our engineers.</p>

            <h3 class="padding-top-30">User Research & Discovery</h3>
            <p>I engaged the Operations Manager to deeply understand existing process gaps and operational challenges, uncovering critical issues affecting service quality for customers. I spoke with engineering managers to hear what engineers really thought about the current form tool. They said it had too many extra steps and bugs, making it frustrating to use.</p>
            
            <p>Many engineers either needed constant help or gave up on the tool altogether, reverting back to paper certificates. These paper certificates couldn't be digitized, creating extra work for their manager and slowing down the process.</p>
            
            <p>The legacy user flow (shown above) illustrates the steps engineers currently take to complete an assessment. In the ideal scenario, the report is automatically generated and emailed to the client and key internal staff, allowing engineers to finish their visit quickly.</p>             
            <p>However, even in this "happy path," operations and customer service teams often face frustration. Simple customer questions can become complicated cross-team efforts to locate certificates, send engineers back for repeat assessments, or process refunds.</p>

            <h3 class="padding-top-30">Secondary Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I ensured legal compliance by researching gas safety report requirements</li>
                <li>I conducted a competitive analysis to identify industry standards</li>
                <li>I evaluated alternative form solutions for features, functionality, and cost</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This research guided my discussions with the Systems Architect and CTO, leading to selecting a Salesforce-based solution as the best fit.</p>

            <h3 class="padding-top-30">Design & Development Approach</h3>
            <p>I designed a mobile-first digital assessment system with automated report generation, email notifications, and Salesforce integration to streamline the entire process from field inspection to customer delivery.</p>

            <h3 class="padding-top-30">User Flows</h3>
            <p>I created user flow journeys to visualize the experiences of engineers, operations, customer service teams, and customers. These flows guided the design process. My main goal was to simplify the gas safety assessment, creating a smooth and positive experience for our engineers.</p>
